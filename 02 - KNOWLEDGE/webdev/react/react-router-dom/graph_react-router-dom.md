# Text Elements
Adding a Router ^VI8yOGUw

1 ^xyM8M3hM

👉 Create and render a browser router in main.jsx ^RZ8svTW2

The Root Route ^mT2SXvza

2 ^kdt5tLWY

Let's add the global layout for this app.

Create src/routes and src/routes/root.jsx
 ^WDLJzzZp

here the important part its the Outlet part
this component its just the root layout ^thsEevKC

👉 Set <Root> as the root route's element ^xQLO7vSU

Handling not Found Errors ^nwRLlvIt

2 ^TB5cxKGG

Anytime your app throws an error while rendering, 
loading data, or performing data mutations, 
React Router will catch it and render an error screen. 
Let's make our own error page. ^saRlDqQC

👉 Create an error page component ^ceayWHMz

useRouteError provides the error that was thrown. 
When the user navigates to routes that don't exist 
you'll get an error response with a "Not Found" 
statusText. ^pkhJ9fXU

👉 Set the <ErrorPage> as the errorElement on the root route ^O3WxCZMY

Create other component (that will be nested)  ^SgGc9j2T

3 ^v1nTleNK

Now create a new route (in a separate layout) ^6Hmrt2Cc

👉 Import the contact component and create a new route ^Mb9PCpoJ

this way the component will NOT be inside the root layout ^6mXjWKgN

Nested Routes ^Zu83zeKP

We want the contact component to render inside of the <Root> layout
We do it by making the contact route a child of the root route. ^HKOVxL4T

👉 Move the contacts route to be a child of the root route ^Z76D1Hq7

use the children property 
to define child routes ^w2v3YMzN

You'll now see the root layout again but a blank page on the right. 
We need to tell the root route where we want it to render its child routes. 
We do that with <Outlet>. ^8tcnlasm

<Outlet /> ^LDC5yX7d

👉 Render an <Outlet> ^jDgFR4Mm

4 ^eBxD0TF8

Client Side Routing (<Link />) ^iI9D1b1v

You may or may not have noticed, but when we click the links in the sidebar, 
the browser is doing a full document request for the next URL instead of using React Router. ^wtypG5aL

Client side routing allows our app to update the URL without requesting another document 
from the server. Instead, the app can immediately render new UI. Let's make it happen with <Link>. ^y6yUyS2a

URL segments, layouts, and data are more often than not coupled (tripled?) together. 
 ^RLT4j7o0

5 ^PvjY4UPI

Loading Data ^TjCX7tHV

There are two APIs we'll be using to load data, loader and useLoaderData. 
First we'll create and export a loader function in the root module, then we'll hook it up to the route. 
Finally, we'll access and render the data ^b4LJYOGQ

the loader function its gets the data 
from some place and return it ^WbtCVOTC

👉 Export a loader from root.jsx ^d8tWKioy

👉 Configure the loader on the route ^5lcFRS2R

👉 Access and render the data ^DIrUuliV

we get the data using useLoaderData() hook ^k7fxTGUo

🤔 ^XZ2kqOV6

Data Writes + HTML Forms ^hGVgftRy

React Router emulates HTML Form navigation as the data mutation primitive ^Dwx93p26

HTML forms actually cause a navigation in the browser, just like clicking a link. 
The only difference is in the request: links can only change the URL while forms can 
also change the request method (GET vs POST) and the request body (POST form data). ^ChroZbuS

Without client side routing, the browser will serialize the form's data automatically 
and send it to the server as the request body for POST, and as URLSearchParams for GET ^bzMic3om

React Router does the same thing, except instead of sending the request to the server, 
it uses client side routing and sends it to a route action. ^YqoU8FZP

can test this out by clicking the "New" button in our app. 
The app should blow up because the Vite server isn't configured to handle a POST request 
(it sends a 404, though it should probably be a 405 🤷). ^RHOY4lcS

5 ^aLZrE7pU

Form actions + adding to router   ^R9eb84mS

We'll create new contacts by exporting an action in our root route, 
wiring it up to the route config, and changing our <form> to a React Router <Form>. ^mPaBwKs5

👉 Create the action and change <form> to <Form> ^c5wGZn1m

👉 Import and set the action on the route ^t6fn6EFB

6 ^H0BdXLeL

URL Params in Loaders ^Gp1FIJmh

<Form> prevents the browser from sending the request to 
the server and sends it to your route action instead. 

In web semantics, a POST usually means some data is changing. 
By convention, React Router uses this as a hint to automatically revalidate 
the data on the page after the action finishes. 

That means all of your useLoaderData hooks update and the UI stays in sync with your 
data automatically! Pretty cool. ^X0jmCDYA

Reviewing the route config, the route looks like this: ^Ay9sPaw4

Note the :contactId URL segment. 
The colon (:) has special meaning, turning it into a "dynamic segment"

Dynamic segments will match dynamic (changing) values in that position of the URL, 
like the contact ID. ^cRKy2EEW

These params are passed to the loader with keys that match the dynamic segment. 
For example, our segment is named :contactId so the value will be passed as params.contactId. ^Q7UShRBn

👉 Add a loader to the contact page and access data with 
useLoaderData ^7WuIG3do

👉 Configure the loader on the route ^EgXwapO0

7 ^x3AtJ9Sa

Updating Data ^dwdMOqIy

Let's make a new route at contacts/:contactId/edit. Again, 
we'll start with the component and then wire it up to the route config. ^Wx6vynAe

👉 Create the edit component ^qbTfeAui

👉 Add the edit page UI ^sZIvXTtr

👉 Add an action to the edit module ^yWOW9y2Q

👉 Wire the action up to the route ^bEw5TSyH

Explaination ^IBPSfAnV

this attribute its wrapped inside
formData object sended by the form
catch by the react-router and 
sended to the action func inside the
route ^4RhJogd6

Since we have a handful of form fields, 
we used Object.fromEntries to collect them all into an object, 
which is exactly what our updateContact function wants. ^woEhYSLh

- request
- request.formData
- Object.fromEntries 
are all provided by the web platform.

After we finished the action, note the redirect at the end: ^BB3mw0tX

Loaders and actions can both return a Response

The redirect helper just makes it easier to return a response 
that tells the app to change locations. ^RRXwUKjz

Without client side routing, if a server redirected after a POST request, 
the new page would fetch the latest data and render. As we learned before,
 React Router emulates this model and automatically revalidates the data on 
the page after the action ^r4yLUUQE

8 ^mlZVdQp2

Redirecting new record to the edit page ^FDTVpzPT

👉 Redirect to the new record's edit page ^0867v31G

now when we click the button inside the form
in this root component (it contains the side bar of the ContactsApp)
it will trigger the action function for creating a new contact and
it will redirect you to the edit contact route ^Q24ggmrI

9 ^i3OHPqWU

Active Link Styling (NavLink) ^5M3GE7cn

👉 Use a NavLink in the sidebar ^oXbuEzaN

10 ^0NQvJhvR

Global Pending UI ^v3Xl25mo

React Router is managing all of the state behind the scenes and reveals the pieces of it 
you need to build dynamic web apps. In this case, we'll use the useNavigation hook. ^7Upzhsmx

👉 useNavigation to add global pending UI ^DwwrKNDP

useNavigation returns the current navigation state: 
it can be one of "idle" | "submitting" | "loading". ^iIL0d5Oq

11 ^r0VZYT6f

Contextual Errors ^BxvUGw5w

if and error happens react-router-dom will
call your errorElement closer to you ^y8S05ACm

12 ^6N91dWTa

Index Routes ^hFRWWebI

When a route has children, and you're at the parent route's path, the <Outlet> has nothing to render because no children match. 
You can think of index routes as the default child route to fill in that space ^qfpEMIaq

👉 Create the index route module ^min4ZTG2

👉 Fill in the index component's elements ^VaYEYxpM

👉 Configure the index route ^9JvAo1oe

Note the { index:true } instead of { path: "" }. ^i9pvf2yF

13 ^YbAY9i6V

Cancel Button (basically navigate backward) ^AXvWmipC

👉 Add the cancel button click handler with useNavigate ^VEqNSAPB

useNavigate hook ^3NmrDfso

navigate(-1) ^Vnt4z4zr

🧐 Why is there no event.preventDefault on the button?

A <button type="button">, while seemingly redundant, 
is the HTML way of preventing a button from submitting its form. ^MMi2FIQK

URL Search Params and GET Submissions ^F9oqSxgi

14 ^YGc335jJ

The search field is interesting because it's a mix of both: it's a form 
but it only changes the URL, it doesn't change data ^DRTZ4ZGJ

normally the form sends the request as a URLSearchParams ^X9MMC6RT

http://127.0.0.1:5173/?q=ryan ^bB5Urb7L

As we've seen before, browsers can serialize forms by the name 
attribute of it's input elements

The name of this input is q, that's why the URL has ?q=. 
If we named it search the URL would be ?search=.

 ^rizxl37D

Note that this form is different from the others we've used, 
it does not have <form method="post">. The default method is "get". 
That means when the browser creates the request for the next document, 
it doesn't put the form data into the request POST body, but into the 
URLSearchParams of a GET request. ^BjT0qRXD

GET Submissions with Client Side Routing ^o0TPN1QS

15 ^58c325X3

Let's use client side routing to submit this form and filter the list in our 
existing loader.

 ^29uqo1Q2

👉 Change <form> to <Form> ^IttSJ5TQ

👉 Filter the list if there are URLSearchParams ^sI7nH8jV

remember the loader function gets the request
made by the Form (client side routing)

It gets the URL and from there it gets the q parameter

Search for the contacts and return it ^4ZPrasrj

Synchronizing URLs to Form State ^OvSGLHzj

16 ^YXENdG8J

In other words, the URL and our form state are out of sync. ^XgXHJ5Bm

👉 Return q from your loader and set it as the search 
field default value ^PnESWnvS

👉 Synchronize input value with the URL Search Params ^AXbcS5bj

Submitting Forms `onChange` (useSubmit) ^GSLty9OE

17 ^DDOPSOyJ

we'd probably rather have the filtering happen on every key stroke instead of when 
the form is explicitly submitted. ^GaidbEDq

👉 Return q from your loader and set it as the search 
field default value ^BQQaSOor

Now as you type, the form is submitted automatically! ^Rh4zBBFs

Note the argument to submit. We're passing in event.currentTarget.form. 
The currentTarget is the DOM node the event is attached to, 
and the currentTarget.form is the input's parent form node. 

The submit function will serialize and submit any form you pass to it. ^g3XTPYi1

Adding Search Spinner ^Sf3PfWI0

18 ^6j8JZX2y

For this we'll use useNavigation again. ^7Jd6899H

👉 Add the search spinner ^Pn9IEYSk

The navigation.location will show up when the app is navigating to a 
new URL and loading the data for it. 

It then goes away when there is no pending navigation anymore. ^sfojHDB4

Managing the History Stack ^E2LsUlx2

19 ^OcfTEohU

Now that the form is submitted for every key stroke, if we type the characters "seba" 
and then delete them with backspace, we end up with 7 new entries in the stack 😂. 
We definitely don't want this ^HWTEzxvi

We can avoid this by replacing the current entry in the history stack with the next page, 
instead of pushing into it. ^f6tqDINl

👉 Use replace in submit ^7OEPLSSP

We only want to replace search results, not the page before we 
started searching, so we do a quick check if this is the first 
search or not and then decide to replace. ^0uBK7k5F

Each key stroke no longer creates new entries, so the user can 
click back out of the search results without having to click it 
7 times 😅. ^h0lYFG1y

Mutations Without Navigation (useFetcher) ^AIifbOUr

20 ^M9hQlTJd

So far all of our mutations (the times we change data) have used forms that navigate, 
creating new entries in the history stack. While these user flows are common, 
it's equally as common to want to change data without causing a navigation. ^noXoPmVE

For these cases, we have the useFetcher hook. It allows us to communicate with loaders 
and actions without causing a navigation. ^uPEiUn0V

👉 Change the <Favorite> form to a fetcher form ^yH1i8xu4

we create a fetcher with useFetcher ^s9cOzhiP

we change the Form with fetcher.Form 
this its the secret sauce for interacting
with the action without triggering a new 
navigation ^NTMu3skQ

👉 Create the action ^OxO0WGVO

👉 Configure the route's new action ^wmqtE9Qa

Optimistic UI ^2cQiNaBs

21 ^yCtD9EWX

To give the user some feedback, we could put the star into a loading state with fetcher.state 
(a lot like navigation.state from before), but we can do something even better this time. 
We can use a strategy called "optimistic UI" ^iKhOpCcy

You probably noticed the app felt kind of unresponsive when we clicked the favorite button 
from the last section. Once again, we added some network latency because you're going to have 
it in the real world! ^AFufOPT6

The fetcher knows the form data being submitted to the action, so it's available to you on fetcher.formData. 
We'll use that to immediately update the star's state, even though the network hasn't finished. 
If the update eventually fails, the UI will revert to the real data. ^GZrnJIFX

👉 Read the optimistic value from fetcher.formData ^yX8QCXL3

If you click the button now you should see the star immediately change to the new state. 
Instead of always rendering the actual data, we check if the fetcher has any formData 
being submitted, if so, we'll use that instead. When the action is done, the fetcher.formData 
will no longer exist and we're back to using the actual data. So even if you write bugs in your 
optimistic UI code, it'll eventually go back to the correct state 🥹 ^POvi7R5I

Not Found Data ^emF74qec

22 ^BqQN91mt

👉 Throw a 404 response in the loader ^G4yEEEiS

Pathless Routes ^cWUc66dd

23 ^PAjkVUSM

Would be better if the errors are rendered inside the root outlet, 
instead of the whole page

In fact, every error in all of our child routes would be better in the outlet, 
then the user has more options than hitting refresh.

We could add the error element to every one of the child routes but, since it's all 
the same error page, this isn't recommended.

There's a cleaner way. Routes can be used without a path, which lets them participate 
in the UI layout without requiring new path segments in the URL ^uHpiszX2

👉 Wrap the child routes in a pathless route ^ImOvOPqn

JSX Routes ^cZhxrHtQ

24 ^p1qGFquI

And for our final trick, many folks prefer to configure their routes with JSX. 
You can do that with createRoutesFromElements. 
There is no functional difference between JSX or objects when configuring your routes, 
it's simply a stylistic preference. ^7gDIC5DM
